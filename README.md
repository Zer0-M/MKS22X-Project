# MKS22X-Project
## Description
We plan to create a clone of the Light Cycle sub-game from the TRON arcade game. In the original game there were multiple light cycles in an arena, these cycles left a trail that acted as a wall for all of the cycles in the arena. The players goal was to make the enemy light cycles(other player or computer) crash into the wall. We will include additional obstacles like a walls that pop-up in random locations.

## Features
There is a 1 player mode where one can play againt a computer driven cycle
There's two player mode where each person control a cycle

There are obstacles to make the game more difficult
Players have the ability to use a speed boost.

## Features added since Demo
